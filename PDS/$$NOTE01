Sam--

I found one more old program, also from UNC Computation Center
(or maybe TUCC) back in the dark ages.  I didn't see it anywhere
else on CBT.  It's called DATOC and is a batch program for
changing DCB attributes of a DASD file on the fly (RECFM, LRECL,
BLKSIZE, EXPDT, space, etc.).  You code the values you want on a
DD statement, and it opens the file and forces those values into
the F1DSCB -- something you probably wouldn't want to do unless
the file were broken in the first place.  The FIXPDS function of
PDS86/STARTOOL can do the same, but this one is batch.

It has to be authorized, so I put it into SYS1.CBT.LINKLIB for
testing, and it's still there.

Enjoy.

Reed
